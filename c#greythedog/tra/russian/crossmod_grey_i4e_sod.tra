@0  = ~[Imoen]Look, Grey! With all my, uh, achievements I also found something for you of course! Here you go!~
@1  = ~[Imoen]Yes, I know it's a bit chewy. But when I saw such a nice piece of dried meat, I just had to think of you!~
@2  = ~[Jaheira]This preserved meat is not the best food for Grey, Imoen. Most of the time it is too salty.~
@3  = ~[Imoen]Yes, alright. Probably won't happen again. (Eat it quickly, Grey, or aunt Jaheira will take it away from you!)~
@4  = ~[Jaheira]Not with that small amount. We should just let Grey drink well at the next opportunity!~
@5  = ~[Imoen]Aye, ma'am!~
