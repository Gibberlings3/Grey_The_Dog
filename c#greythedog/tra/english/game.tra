@10000  = ~Wolfhound~
@10001  = ~Wolfhound: This breed of dog is one of the largest non-magical dogs seen in nature. Some specimens have measured over 3 ft at the shoulder and can stand some 7 ft in height on their hind legs. The wolfhound was originally bred as a coursing hound. Sleek yet large these dogs made excellent hunting animals no matter the prey. Being less common than the typical war dog, wolfhounds are rarely seen in Realms these days and are highly sought after as breeding stock by nobles and commoners alike.

  Wolfhounds are more intelligent than the average street dog.  They make excellent companions and, once you earn their trust, steadfast defenders.


  Advantages:
  -Attack speed factor -1 every 10 levels from level 1.
  -Movement modifier -1 at levels 1,5 and every 10 levels thereafter.
  -Gains Tracking Ability at level 7 plus 1 extra use every 5 levels thereafter.
  -At level 5 gains immunity to blindness: the wolfhound detects his enemies with his sense of smell.
  -At level 6 gains Bark: will instill fear and panic in enemies and bolster his own resistance to fear. At later levels this resistance expands to include the party as well as all effects increasing in duration. Gains an extra use every 6 levels.
  -At level 8 gains True Sight: the wolfhound's nose is not fooled by invisibility or simple illusions. Gains an extra use every 8 levels.
  -At level 10 gains Alpha Call: can call on any dogs in the local area to come to his aid.  The dogs called improve as the wolfhound becomes more powerful. Gains an extra use every 10 levels. This ability does not work indoors.

  -Due to their special training, wolfhounds have a +1 THAC0 and damage bonus against humans, wolves, and bears and gain an additional +1 bonus at level 5 and every 10th level thereafter.
 
  Disadvantages:
  -Cannot use conventional weapons or armor.
  -Smells bad when wet.
  -Leaves hair everywhere.
